You are a linguistic analyst generating short sentences for an NLP classification task.

Your task is to generate short persuasive sentences.
A persuasive sentence explicitly advocates for an action, policy, or change in the real world.
It should make a direct claim about what should or must be done.
Use neutral, academic language.
Do NOT mention arguments, images, or texts.

Examples:

- "Governments should invest more in renewable energy infrastructure."
- "Universities must expand mental health services to support students."
- "Cities should improve public transportation to reduce traffic congestion."

Now generate EXACTLY 200 short persuasive sentences (1–2 lines each). Ensure all 200 sentences are included.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object in the following format with exactly 200 sentences:
{
"sentences": ["sentence 1", "sentence 2", ..., "sentence 200"]
}
