Default is 'lbfgs'.<br>To choose a solver, you might want to consider the following aspects:<br><br>- 'lbfgs' is a good default solver because it works reasonably well for a wide<br>  class of problems.<br>- For :term:`multiclass` problems (`n_classes >= 3`), all solvers except<br>  'liblinear' minimize the full multinomial loss, 'liblinear' will raise an<br>  error.<br>- 'newton-cholesky' is a good choice for<br>  `n_samples` >> `n_features * n_classes`, especially with one-hot encoded<br>  categorical features with rare categories. Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.

However, closer inspection revealed a systematic difference in sentence length between persuasive and neutral samples. To investigate this potential confound, I conducted an ablation study and found that a length-only classifier achieved ~98% accuracy, indicating that sentence length was a dominant confounding signal introduced by the data generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, I regenerated both classes with explicit word-count constraints, equalizing sentence length distributions across labels. After controlling for length, the same TF-IDF pipeline achieved 87.5% accuracy on a balanced test set. While performance decreased compared to the confounded setting, this drop was expected and desirable, as it indicates the model could no longer rely on superficial length cues and instead learned lexical signals of persuasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of the confusion matrix showed a slight tendency to over-predict persuasion, suggesting that remaining errors are driven by linguistic ambiguity rather than dataset artifacts. Overall, this project demonstrates a complete experimental loop: baseline modeling, confound identification, controlled regeneration, and honest re-evaluation. The results show that lexical cues alone provide substantial signal for persuasion detection, validating the pipeline as a meaningful and interpretable baseline."
